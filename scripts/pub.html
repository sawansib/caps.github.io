	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Various memory consistency model implementations (e.g., x86, SPARC) willfully allow a core to see its own stores while they are in limbo, i.e., executed (and perhaps retired) but not yet inserted in memory order. This is known as store-to-load forwarding and it is a necessity to safeguard the local thread's sequential program semantics while achieving high performance. However, this can lead to counter-intuitive behaviours, requiring fences to prevent such behaviours when needed.Other vendors (e.g., IBM 370 and the z/Architecture series) opt for enforcing what we call in this work store atomicity, that is, disallowing a core to see its own stores before they are written to memory, trading off performance for a more intuitive memory model. Ideally, we want a stricter model to ease programability at the same time that architects can provide high-performance solutions. We make a simple observation. What holds for any other rule in a consistency model, also holds for store atomicity: it is not a crime to break the rule, unless we get caught.In this work, we detail the different ways of detecting a store atomicity violation. This leads us to a new insight: a load performed by a forwarding from an in-limbo store is not speculative; younger loads performed after that forwarding are. Based on this insight we propose an effective and cheap speculative approach to dynamically enforce store atomicity only when the detection of its violation actually occurs. In practice, these cases are rare during the execution of a program. In all other cases (the bulk of the execution of a program) store-to-load forwarding can be done without violating store atomicity. The end result is that we provide the best of both worlds: a more intuitive store-atomic memory model, i.e., the 370 model, with the performance and cost approaching (at an average of just 2.5% and 2.7% overhead for parallel and sequential applications, respectively) that of a non-store-atomic model, i.e., the x86 model.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtually all processors today employ a store buffer (SB) to hide store latency. However, when the store buffer is full, store latency is exposed to the processor causing pipeline stalls. The default strategies to mitigate these stalls are to issue prefetch for ownership requests when store instructions commit and to continuously increase the store buffer size. While these strategies considerably increase memory-level parallelism for stores, there are still applications that suffer deeply from stalls caused by the store buffer. Even worse, store-buffer induced stalls increase considerably when simultaneous multi-threading is enabled, as the store buffer is statically partitioned among the threads.<br>In this paper, we propose a highly selective and very aggressive prefetching strategy to minimize store-buffer induced stalls. Our proposal, Store-Prefetch Burst (SPB), is based on the following insights: i) the majority of store-buffer induced stalls are caused by a few stores; ii) the access pattern of such stores are easily predictable; and iii) the latency of the stores is not commonly hidden by standard cache prefetchers, as hiding their latency would require tremendous prefetch aggressiveness. SPB accurately detects contiguous store-access patterns (requiring just 67 bits of storage) and prefetches the remaining memory blocks of the accessed page in a single burst request to the L1 controller. SPB matches the performance of a 1024-entry SB implementation on a 56-entry SB (i.e., Skylake architecture). For a 14-entry SB (e.g., running four logical cores), it achieves 95.0% of that ideal performance, on average, for SPEC CPU 2017. Additionally, a<br>20-entry store buffer that incorporates SPB achieves the average performance of a standard 56-entry store buffer.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Since the introduction of Meltdown and Spectre, the research community has been tirelessly working on speculative side-channel attacks and on how to shield computer systems from them. To ensure that a system is protected not only from all the currently known attacks but also from future, yet to be discovered, attacks, the solutions developed need to be general in nature, covering a wide array of system components, while at the same time keeping the performance, energy, area, and implementation complexity costs at a minimum. One such solution is our own delay-on-miss, which efficiently protects the memory hierarchy by i) selectively delaying speculative load instructions and ii) utilizing value prediction as an invisible form of speculation. In this work we dive deeper into delay-on-miss, offering insights into why and how it affects the performance of the system. We also reevaluate value prediction as an invisible form of speculation. Specifically, we focus on the implications that delaying memory loads has in the memory level parallelism of the system and how this affects the value predictor and the overall performance of the system. We present new, updated results but more importantly, we also offer deeper insight into why delay-on-miss works so well and what this means for the future of secure speculative execution.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The store buffer, an essential component in today's processors, isdesigned to hide memory latency by moving stores off the processor's critical path. Furthermore, under the Total Store Order (TSO)memory model, the store buffer ensures the in-order retirement ofstores. Problems arise when the store buffer is full or, under TSO,when the leading store encounters a cache miss, which blocks allsubsequent stores and incurs severe performance bottlenecks.This work presents a software-hardware co-designed approachto cope with this bottleneck for processors with strong consistencyguarantees. Our proposal is driven by the insight that store operations can be reordered if their reordering does not change theobservable program behavior. The compiler delineates safe regionswithin which stores can be shuffled while still delivering the sameobservable behavior as if they performed in program order andunsafe regions within which stores must be kept in program order.This is leveraged by a novel dual-mode store buffer that switchesbetween the out-of-order and in-order execution of stores withinthe safe and respectively unsafe regions. Correctness is preservedthrough well-placed fences inserted by the compiler, which impedethe execution of stores from the following regions until all storesof the current region complete. Our dual-mode store buffer onlyrequires one extra bit per entry, significantly decreases processorstall cycles, and brings 8.13% performance improvements comparedto a mainstream store buffer.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Existing best-effort requester-wins implementations of transactional memory must resort to non-speculative execution to provide forward progress in the presence of transactions that exceed hardware capacity, experience page faults or suffer high-contention leading to livelocks. Current approaches to irrevocability employ lock-based synchronization to achieve mutual exclusion when executing a transaction non-speculatively, conservatively precluding concurrency with any other transactions in order to guarantee atomicity at the cost of degrading performance. In this article, we propose a new form of concurrent irrevocability whose goal is to minimize the loss of concurrency paid when transactions resort to irrevocability to complete. By enabling optimistic concurrency control also during non-speculative execution of a transaction, our proposal allows for higher parallelism than existing schemes. We describe the extensions to the instruction set to provide concurrent irrevocable transactions as well as the architectural extensions required to realize them on a best-effort HTM system without requiring any modification to the cache coherence protocol. Our evaluation shows that our proposal achieves an average reduction of 12.5 percent in execution time across the STAMP benchmarks, with 15.8 percent on average for highly contended workloads.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Page faults occurring within transactions jeopardize concurrency in Intel Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM). To make progress in spite of page-fault-induced aborts, the program must resort to the non-speculative fallback path and re-execute the affected transaction. Since the atomicity of a non-speculative transaction is guaranteed by impeding the execution of any other speculative transactions until the former completes, taking the fallback path is particularly harmful for performance. Therefore, such page-fault-induced aborts currently lead to thread serialization during the potentially long period of time taken to resolve them. In this work we propose PfTouch, a simple extension to RTM that allows page-fault handling to be moved out of non-speculative transactional execution in mutual exclusion. Our proposal sidesteps taking the fallback path in these cases and thus avoids its associated performance loss, by triggering page faults in the abort handler while other speculative transactions can run concurrently. PfTouch requires minimal modifications in the Intel RTM specification and keeps the OS unaltered. Through full-system simulation, we show that PfTouch achieves average reductions in execution time of 7.7% (up to 24.4%) for the STAMP benchmarks, closely matching the performance of the more complex suspended transactional mode in the IBM Power ISA.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Out-of-order processors heavily rely on speculation to achieve highperformance, allowing instructions to bypass other slower instructions in order to fully utilize the processor's resources. Speculativelyexecuted instructions do not affect the correctness of the application, as they never change the architectural state, but they do affectthe micro-architectural behavior of the system. Until recently, thesechanges were considered to be safe but with the discovery of newsecurity attacks that misuse speculative execution to leak secreteinformation through observable micro-architectural changes (socalled side-channels), this is no longer the case. To solve this issue,a wave of software and hardware mitigations have been proposed,the majority of which delay and/or hide speculative execution untilit is deemed to be safe, trading performance for security. Thesenewly enforced restrictions change how speculation is applied andwhere the performance bottlenecks appear, forcing us to rethinkhow we design and optimize both the hardware and the software.We observe that many of the state-of-the-art hardware solutionstargeting memory systems operate on a common scheme: the visible execution of loads or their dependents is blocked until theybecome safe to execute. In this work we propose a generally applicable hardware-software extension that focuses on removing thecauses of loads' unsafety, generally caused by control and memorydependence speculation. As a result, we manage to make more loadssafe to execute at an early stage, which enables us to schedule moreloads at a time to overlap their delays and improve performance.We apply our techniques on the state-of-the-art Delay-on-Misshardware defense and show that we reduce the performance gapto the unsafe baseline by 53% (on average).</td>

The existing proposals perform the private/shared classification at page granularity, leading to a noticeable amount of miss-classified memory blocks.We propose a mechanism that works on block granularity using the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) to make accurate detection of private data, which increases the effectiveness of proposals relying on a private/shared classification.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Modern processors contain store-buffers to allow stores to retire under a miss, thus hiding store-miss latency. The store-buffer needs to be large (for performance) and searched on every load (for correctness), thereby making it a costly structure in both area and energy. Yet on every load, the store-buffer is probed in parallel with the L1 and TLB, with no concern for the store-buffer's intrinsic hit rate or whether a store-buffer hit can be predicted to save energy by disabling the L1 and TLB probes. In this work we cache data that have been written back to memory in a unified store-queue/buffer/cache, and predict hits to avoid L1/TLB probes and save energy. By dynamically adjusting the allocation of entries between the store-queue/buffer/cache, we can achieve nearly optimal reuse, without causing stalls. We are able to do this efficiently and cheaply by recognizing key properties of stores: free caching (since they must be written into the store-buffer for correctness we need no additional data movement), cheap coherence (since we only need to track state changes of the local, dirty data in the store-buffer), and free and accurate hit prediction (since the memory dependence predictor already does this for scheduling). As a result, we are able to increase the store-buffer hit rate and reduce store-buffer/TLB/L1 dynamic energy by 11.8% (up to 26.4%) on SPEC2006 without hurting performance (average IPC improvements of 1.5%, up to 4.7%). The cost for these improvements is a 0.2% increase in L1 cache capacity (1 bit per line) and one additional tail pointer in the store-buffer.</td>

In fact, current systems implement prefetchers at every cache level. Timeliness is an essential property for getting the maximum performance from the prefetcher, as bringing the data early to cache can increase its miss ratio and requesting the data too late can lead to sub-optimal performance. This paper presents Berti, a prefetcher that finds the delta that provides the best timeliness for memory blocks in each page. The prefetcher works in two modes: (i) on the first access to a block, in a certain period of time, the prefetcher issues a request for the next block according to the best delta found; (ii) for cold pages, a burst mechanism fetches blocks that cannot be reached adding the delta to the current accessed block.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Speculative execution is necessary for achieving high performance on modern general-purpose CPUs but, starting with Spectre and Meltdown, it has also been proven to cause severe security flaws. In case of a misspeculation, the architectural state is restored to assure functional correctness but a multitude of microarchitectural changes (e.g., cache updates), caused by the speculatively executed instructions, are commonly left in the system. These changes can be used to leak sensitive information, which has led to a frantic search for solutions that can eliminate such security flaws. The contribution of this work is an evaluation of the cost of hiding speculative side-effects in the cache hierarchy, making them visible only after the speculation has been resolved. For this, we compare (for the first time) two broad approaches: I) waiting for loads to become non-speculative before issuing them to the memory system, and ii) eliminating the side-effects of speculation, a solution consisting of invisible loads (Ghost loads) and performance optimizations (Ghost Buffer and Materialization). While previous work, InvisiSpec, has proposed a similar solution to our latter approach, it has done so with only a minimal evaluation and at a significant performance cost. The detailed evaluation of our solutions shows that: I) waiting for loads to become non-speculative is no more costly than the previously proposed InvisiSpec solution, albeit much simpler, non-invasive in the memory system, and stronger security-wise; ii) hiding speculation with Ghost loads (in the context of a relaxed memory model) can be achieved at the cost of 12% performance degradation and 9% energy increase, which is significantly better that the previous state-of-the-art solution.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Speculative execution, the base on which modern high-performance general-purpose CPUs are built on, has recently been shown to enable a slew of security attacks. All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions. In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This manuscript opens the way to a new class of coherence directory structures that are based on the brand-new concept of way combining. A Way-Combining Directory (WC-dir) builds on a typical sparse directory but allows to take advantage of several ways in the same set to codify the sharing information of each memory block. The result is a sparse directory with variable effective associativity per set and variable length entries, thus being able to dynamically adapt the directory structure to the particular requirements of each application. In particular, our proposal uses just enough bits per entry to store a single pointer, which is optimal for the common case of having just one sharer. For those addresses that have more than one sharer, we have observed that in the majority of cases extra bits could be taken from other empty ways in the same set. All in all, our proposal minimizes the storage overheads without losing the flexibility to adapt to several sharing degrees and without the complexities of other previously proposed techniques. Detailed simulations of a 128-core multicore architecture running benchmarks from PARSEC-3.0 and SPLASH-3 demonstrate that WC-dir can closely approach the performance of a non-scalable bit vector sparse directory, beating the state-of-the-art Scalable Coherence Directory (SCD) and Pool directory proposals.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cache coherence protocols based on self-invalidation and self-downgrade have recently seen increased popularity due to their simplicity, potential performance efficiency, and low energy consumption. However, such protocols result in memory instruction reordering, thus causing extra program behaviors that are often not intended by the programmers. We propose a novel formal model that captures the semantics of programs running under such protocols, and features a set of fences that interact with the coherence layer. Using the model, we design an algorithm to analyze the reachability and check whether a program satisfies a given safety property with the current set of fences. We describe a method for insertion of optimal sets of fences that ensure correctness of the program under such protocols. The method relies on a counter-example guided fence insertion procedure. One feature of our method is that it can handle a variety of fences (with different costs). This diversity makes optimization more difficult since one has to optimize the total cost of the inserted fences, rather than just their number. To demonstrate the strength of our approach, we have implemented a prototype and run it on a wide range of examples and benchmarks. We have also, using simulation, evaluated the performance of the resulting fenced programs.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Directory-based coherence protocols (Directory) are considered the design of choice to provide maximum performance in coherence maintenance for shared-memory many-core CMPs, despite their large memory overhead. New solutions are emerging to achieve acceptable levels of on-chip area overhead and energy consumption such as optimized encoding of block sharers in Directory (e.g., SCD) or broadcast-based coherence (e.g., Hammer). In this work, we propose a novel and efficient solution for the cache coherence problem in many-core systems based on the co-design of the coherence protocol and the interconnection network. Particularly, we propose ECONO, a cache coherence protocol tailored to future many-core systems that resorts on PhotoBNoC, a special lightweight dedicated silicon-photonic subnetwork for efficient delivery of the atomic broadcast coherence messages used by the protocol. Considering a simulated 256-core system, as compared with Hammer, we demonstrate that ECONO+PhotoBNoC reduces performance and energy consumption by an average of 34% and 32%, respectively. Additionally, our proposal lowers the area overhead entailed by SCD by 2×.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data-race-free (DRF) parallel programming becomes a standard as newly adopted memory models of mainstream programming languages such as C++ or Java impose data-race-freedom as a requirement. We propose compiler techniques that automatically delineate extended data-race-free (xDRF) regions, namely regions of code that provide the same guarantees as the synchronization-free regions (in the context of DRF codes). xDRF regions stretch across synchronization boundaries, function calls and loop back-edges and preserve the data-race-free semantics, thus increasing the optimization opportunities exposed to the compiler and to the underlying architecture. We further enlarge xDRF regions with a conflict isolation (CI) technique, delineating what we call xDRF-CI regions while preserving the same properties as xDRF regions. Our compiler (1) precisely analyzes the threads' memory accessing behavior and data sharing in shared-memory, general-purpose parallel applications, (2) isolates data-sharing and (3) marks the limits of xDRF-CI code regions. The contribution of this work consists in a simple but effective method to alleviate the drawbacks of the compiler's conservative nature in order to be competitive with (and even surpass) an expert in delineating xDRF regions manually. We evaluate the potential of our technique by employing xDRF and xDRF-CI region classification in a state-of-the-art, dual-mode cache coherence protocol. We show that xDRF regions reduce the coherence bookkeeping and enable optimizations for performance (6.4 percent) and energy efficiency (12.2 percent) compared to a standard directory-based coherence protocol. Enhancing the xDRF analysis with the conflict isolation technique improves performance by 7.1 percent and energy efficiency by 15.9 percent.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We present a non-speculative solution for a coalescing store buffer in total store order (TSO) consistency. Coalescing violates TSO with respect to both conflicting loads and conflicting stores, if partial state is exposed to the memory system. Proposed solutions for coalescing in TSO resort to speculation-and-rollback or centralized arbitration to guarantee atomicity for the set of stores whose order is affected by coalescing. These solutions can suffer from scalability, complexity, resource-conflict deadlock, and livelock problems. A non-speculative solution that writes out coalesced cachelines, one at a time, over a typical directory-based MESI coherence layer, has the potential to transcend these problems if it can guarantee absence of deadlock in a practical way. There are two major problems for a non-speculative coalescing store buffer: i) how to present to the memory system a group of coalesced writes as atomic, and ii) how to not deadlock while attempting to do so. For this, we introduce a new lexicographical order. Relying on this order, conflicting atomic groups of coalesced writes can be individually performed per cache block, without speculation, rollback, or replay, and without deadlock or livelock, yet appear atomic to conflicting parties and preserve TSO. One of our major contributions is to show that lexicographical orders based on a small part of the physical address (sub-address order) are deadlock-free throughout the system when taking into account resource-conflict deadlocks. Our approach exceeds the performance and energy benefits of two baseline TSO store buffers and matches the coalescing (and energy savings) of a release-consistency store buffer, at comparable cost.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In an out-of-order core, the load queue (LQ), the store queue (SQ), and the store buffer (SB) are responsible for ensuring: i) correct forwarding of stores to loads and ii) correct ordering among loads (with respect to external stores). The first requirement safeguards the sequential semantics of program execution and applies to both serial and parallel code; the second requirement safeguards the semantics of coherence and consistency (e.g., TSO). In particular, loads search the SQ/SB for the latest value that may have been produced by a store, and stores and invalidations search the LQ to find speculative loads in case they violate uniprocessor or multiprocessor ordering. To meet timing constraints the LQ and SQ/SB system is composed of CAM structures that are frequently searched. This results in high complexity, cost, and significant difficulty to scale, but is the current state of the art. Prior research demonstrated the feasibility of a non-Associative LQ by replaying loads at commit. There is a steep cost however: A significant increase in L1 accesses and contention for L1 ports. This is because prior work assumes Sequential Consistency and completely ignores the existence of a SB in the system. In contrast, we intentionally delay stores in the SB to achieve a total management of stores and loads in a core, while still supporting TSO. Our main result is that we eliminate the LQ without burdening the L1 with extra accesses. Store forwarding is achieved by delaying our own stores until speculatively issued loads are validated on commit, entirely in-core; TSO load→load ordering is preserved by delaying remote external stores in their SB until our own speculative reordered loads commit. While the latter is inspired by recent work on non-speculative load reordering, our contribution here is to show that this can be accomplished without having a load queue. Eliminating the LQ results in both energy savings and performance improvement from the elimination of LQ-induced stalls.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Recent proposals are based on classifying memory accesses into private or shared in order to process private accesses more efficiently and reduce coherence overhead. The classification mechanisms previously proposed are either not able to adapt to the dynamic sharing behavior of the applications or require frequent broadcast messages. Additionally, most of these classification approaches assume single-level translation lookaside buffers (TLBs). However, deeper and more efficient TLB hierarchies, such as the ones implemented in current commodity processors, have not been appropriately explored. This paper analyzes accurate classification mechanisms in multilevel TLB hierarchies. In particular, we propose an efficient data classification strategy for systems with distributed shared last-level TLBs. Our approach classifies data accounting for temporal private accesses and constrains TLB-related traffic by issuing unicast messages on first-level TLB misses. When our classification is employed to deactivate coherence for private data in directory-based protocols, it improves the directory efficiency and, consequently, reduces coherence traffic to merely 53.0 percent, on average. Additionally, it avoids some of the overheads of previous classification approaches for purely private TLBs, improving average execution time by nearly 9 percent for large-scale systems.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Maintaining coherence across hundreds or even thousands of cores is not an easy task. Among all of the proposed solutions until now, directory-based cache coherence has been advocated as the most feasible way of beating the scalability hurdles that arise at such large scale. Thanks to the knowledge accumulated during the last four decades, there is general consensus on the impact of most of the design aspects of directory coherence on performance, energy consumption and cost. However, there is one subtle design point for which we have observed some divergences in contemporary research works on cache-coherent multicores. Specifically, while some recent works assume a silent replacement policy for evictions of clean data in the last-level private caches, others implement just the opposite that we call a noisy replacement policy, and even others do not mention how these evictions are managed. In this work, we put this important aspect into the spotlight, demonstrating that the way in which evictions of clean data are managed can have important influence on the performance and energy consumption of a directory-based cache coherence protocol. We show that the noisy replacement policy leads to a significant increase in the total traffic (around 20% in several cases, 9.6% on average) compared with the silent policy. Given the important fraction of the total power budget that the on-chip interconnection network of future manycores is expected to consume, assuming the silent replacement policy for clean data will lead to non-negligible energy savings. Moreover, and what is more important, we have observed that depending on the particular directory structure used, assuming silent replacements could affect performance or not. This means that the use of noisy replacements is not justified in all cases, since it would increase unnecessarily network traffic without leading to any performance advantages.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data-race-free (DRF) parallel programming becomes a standard as newly adopted memory models of mainstream programming languages such as C++ or Java impose data-race-freedom as a requirement. We propose compiler techniques that automatically delineate extended data-race-free regions (xDRF), namely regions of code which provide the same guarantees as the synchronization-free regions (in the context of DRF codes). xDRF regions stretch across synchronization boundaries, function calls and loop back-edges and preserve the data-race-free semantics, thus increasing the optimization opportunities exposed to the compiler and to the underlying architecture. Our compiler techniques precisely analyze the threads' memory accessing behavior and data sharing in shared-memory, general-purpose parallel applications and can therefore infer the limits of xDRF code regions. We evaluate the potential of our technique by employing the xDRF region classification in a state-of-the-art, dualmode cache coherence protocol. Larger xDRF regions reduce the coherence bookkeeping and enable optimizations for performance (6.8%) and energy efficiency (11.7%) compared to a standard directory-based coherence protocol.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: textcopyright 2017 Association for Computing Machinery. In Total Store Order memory consistency (TSO), loads can be speculatively reordered to improve performance. If a load-load reordering is seen by other cores, speculative loads must be squashed and re-executed. In architectures with an unordered interconnection network and directory coherence, this has been the established view for decades. We show, for the frst time, that it is not necessary to squash and re-execute speculatively reordered loads in TSO when their reordering is seen. Instead, the reordering can be hidden form other cores by the coherence protocol. The implication is that we can irrevocably bind speculative loads. This allows us to commit reordered loads out-of-order without having to wait (for the loads to become non-speculative) or without having to checkpoint committed state (and rollback if needed), just to ensure correctness in the rare case of some core seeing the reordering. We show that by exposing a reordering to the coherence layer and by appropriately modifying a typical directory protocol we can successfully hide load-load reordering without perceptible performance cost and without deadlock. Our solution is cost-effective and increases the performance of out-of-order commit by a sizable margin, compared to the base case where memory operations are not allowed to commit if the consistency model could be violated.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cache coherence protocols based on self-invalidation allow simpler hardware implementation compared to traditional write-invalidation protocols, by relying on data-race-free semantics and applying self-invalidation on synchronization points. Their simplicity lies in the absence of invalidation traffic. This eliminates the need to track readers in a directory, and reduces the number of transient protocol states. Similarly, the use of self-downgrade on synchronization eliminates directory indirection, and hence the need to track writers in a directory. These protocols, effectively without a directory, have the potential to reduce area, energy consumption, and complexity, without sacrificing performance - provided, that self-invalidation and self-downgrade are performed prudently. In this work we examine how self-invalidation and self-downgrade are performed in relation to atomicity and ordering. We show that self-invalidation and self-downgrade do not need to be applied conservatively, as so far implemented. Our key observation is that, often, critical sections which are not ordered in time, are intended to provide only atomicity and not thread synchronization. We thus propose a new type of self-invalidation, forwardself-invalidation (FSI), which invalidates solely data that are going to be accessed inside a critical section. Based on the same reasoning, we propose a new type of self-downgrade, forward self-downgrade (FSD), also restricted to writes in critical sections. Finally, we define the semantics of locks using FSI and FSD, which resemble the semantics of relaxed atomic operations in C++. Our evaluation for 64-core multiprocessors shows significant improvements using the proposed FSI and FSD - where applicable - in Splash-3 and PARSEC benchmarks, over a directory-based protocol (17.1 percent in execution time and 33.9 percent in energy consumption) and also over a state-of-the-art self-invalidation/self-downgrade protocol (7.6 percent in execution time and 9.1 percent in energy consumption), while still retaining the design simplicity of the protocol.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Today, general-purpose commercial multicores approaching one hundred cores are already a reality and even thousand core chips are being prototyped. Maintaining coherence across such a high number of cores in these manycore architectures requires careful design of the coherence directory used to keep track of current locations of the memory blocks at the private cache level. In this work we propose a novel organization for the coherence directory that builds on the brand-new concept of way combining. Particularly, our proposal employs just one pointer per entry, which is optimal for the common case of having just one sharer. For those addresses that require more than one pointer, we have observed that in the majority of cases extra pointers could be taken from other empty ways in the same set. Thus, our proposal minimizes the storage overheads without losing the flexibility to adapt to several sharing degrees and without the complexities of other previously proposed techniques. Through detailed simulations of a 128-core architecture, we show that the way-combining directory closely approaches the performance of a non-scalable bit-vector sparse directory, and beats other scalable state-of-the-art proposals.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Power consumption in current high-performance chip multiprocessors (CMPs) has become a major design concern that aggravates with the current trend of increasing the core count. A significant fraction of the total power budget is consumed by on-chip caches which are usually deployed with a high associativity degree (even L1 caches are being implemented with eight ways) to enhance the system performance. On a cache access, each way in the corresponding set is accessed in parallel, which is costly in terms of energy. On the other hand, coherence protocols also must implement efficient directory caches that scale in terms of power consumption. Most of the state-of-the-art techniques that reduce the energy consumption of directories are at the cost of performance, which may become unacceptable for high-performance CMPs. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient architectural design that can be effectively applied to any kind of cache memory. The proposed approach, called the Tag Filter (TF) Architecture, filters the ways accessed in the target cache set, and just a few ways are searched in the tag and data arrays. This allows the approach to reduce the dynamic energy consumption of caches without hurting their access time. For this purpose, the proposed architecture holds the X least significant bits of each tag in a small auxiliary X-bit-wide array. These bits are used to filter the ways where the least significant bits of the tag do not match with the bits in the X-bit array. Experimental results show that, on average, the TF Architecture reduces the dynamic power consumption across the studied applications up to 74.9%, 85.9%, and 84.5% when applied to L1 caches, L2 caches, and directory caches, respectively.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Hardware transactional memory (HTM) systems have been studied extensively along the dimensions of speculative versioning and contention management policies. The relative performance of several designs policies has been discussed at length in prior work within the framework of scalable chipmultiprocessing systems. Yet, the impact of simple structural optimizations like write-buffering has not been investigated and performance deviations due to the presence or absence of these optimizations remains unclear. This lack of insight into the effective use and impact of these interfacial structures between the processor core and the coherent memory hierarchy forms the crux of the problem we study in this paper. Through detailed modeling of various write-buffering configurations we show that they play a major role in determining the overall performance of a practical HTM system. Our study of both eager and lazy conflict resolution mechanisms in a scalable parallel architecture notes a remarkable convergence of the performance of these two diametrically opposite design points when write buffers are introduced and used well to support the common case. Mitigation of redundant actions, fewer invalidations on abort, latency-hiding and prefetch effects contribute towards reducing execution times for transactions. Shorter transaction durations also imply a lower contention probability, thereby amplifying gains even further. The insights, related to the interplay between buffering mechanisms, system policies and workload characteristics, contained in this paper clearly distinguish gains in performance to be had from write-buffering from those that can be ascribed to HTM policy. We believe that this information would facilitate sound design decisions when incorporating HTMs into parallel architectures. textcopyright 2011 IEEE.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: When supported in silicon, transactional memory (TM) promises to become a fast, simple and scalable parallel programming paradigm for future shared memory multiprocessor systems. Among the multitude of hardware TM design points and policies that have been studied so far, lazy conflict resolution designs often extract the most concurrency, but their inherent need for lazy versioning requires careful management of speculative updates. In this paper we study how coherent buffering, in private caches for example, as has been proposed in several hardware TM proposals, can lead to inefficiencies. We then show how such inefficiencies can be substantially mitigated by using complete or partial non-coherent buffering of speculative writes in dedicated structures or suitably adapted standard per-core write-buffers. These benefits are particularly noticeable in scenarios involving large coarse grained transactions that may write a lot of non-contended data in addition to actively shared data. We believe our analysis provides important insights into some overlooked aspects of TM behaviour and would prove useful to designers wishing to implement lazy TM schemes in hardware. textcopyright 2011 IEEE.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: HPCTOOLKIT is an integrated suite of tools that supports measurement, analysis, attribution, and presentation of application performance for both sequential and parallel programs. HPCTOOLKIT can pinpoint and quantify scalability bottlenecks in fully optimized parallel programs with a measurement overhead of only a few percent. Recently, new capabilities were added to HPCTOOLKIT for collecting call path profiles for fully optimized codes without any compiler support, pinpointing and quantifying bottlenecks in multithreaded programs, exploring performance information and source code using a new user interface, and displaying hierarchical space-time diagrams based on traces of asynchronous call path samples. This paper provides an overview of HPCTOOLKIT and illustrates its utility for performance analysis of parallel applications. Copyright textcopyright 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Although directory-based cache-coherence protocols are the best choice when designing chip multiprocessors with tens of cores on-chip, the memory overhead introduced by the directory structure may not scale gracefully with the number of cores. Many approaches aimed at improving the scalability of directories have been proposed. However, they do not bring perfect scalability and usually reduce the directory memory overhead by compressing coherence information, which in turn results in extra unnecessary coherence messages and, therefore, wasted energy and some performance degradation. In this work, we present a distributed directory organization based on duplicate tags for tiled CMP architectures whose size is independent on the number of tiles of the system up to a certain number of tiles. We demonstrate that this number of tiles corresponds to the number of sets in the private caches. Additionally, we show that the area overhead of the proposed directory structure is 0.56% with respect to the on-chip data caches. Moreover, the proposed directory structure keeps the same information than a non-scalable full-map directory. Finally, we propose a mechanism that takes advantage of this directory organization to remove the network traffic caused by replacements. This mechanism reduces total traffic by 15% for a 16-core configuration compared to a traditional directory-based protocol. textcopyright 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we present a lossy compression scheme based on the application of the 3D fast wavelet transform to code medical video. This type of video has special features, such as its representation in gray scale, its very few interframe variations, and the quality requirements of the reconstructed images. These characteristics as well as the social impact of the desired applications demand a design and implementation of coding schemes especially oriented to exploit them. We analyze different parameters of the codification process, such as the utilization of different wavelets functions, the number of steps the wavelet function is applied to, the way the thresholds are chosen, and the selected methods in the quantization and entropy encoder. In order to enhance our original encoder, we propose several improvements in the entropy encoder: 3D-conscious run-length, hexadecimal coding and the application of arithmetic coding instead of Huffman. Our coder achieves a good trade-off between compression ratio and quality of the reconstructed video. We have also compared our scheme with MPEG-2 and EZW, obtaining better compression ratios up to 119% and 46%, respectively for the same PSNR. textcopyright 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In many-core architectures, memory blocks are commonly assigned to the banks of a NUCA cache by following a physical mapping. This mapping assigns blocks to cache banks in a round-robin fashion, thus neglecting the distance between the cores that most frequently access every block and the corresponding NUCA bank for the block. This issue impacts both cache access latency and the amount of on-chip network traffic generated. On the other hand, first-touch mapping policies, which take into account distance, can lead to an unbalanced utilization of cache banks, and consequently, to an increased number of expensive off-chip accesses. In this work, we propose the distance-aware round-robin mapping policy, an OS-managed policy which addresses the trade-off between cache access latency and number of off-chip accesses. Our policy tries to map the pages accessed by a core to its closest (local) bank, like in a firsttouch policy. However, our policy also introduces an upper bound on the deviation of the distribution of memory pages among cache banks, which lessens the number of off-chip accesses. This tradeoff is addressed without requiring any extra hardware structure. We also show that the private cache indexing commonly used in many-core architectures is not the most appropriate for OS-managed distance-aware mapping policies, and propose to employ different bits for such indexing. Using GEMS simulator we show that our proposal obtains average improvements of 11% for parallel applications and 14% for multi-programmed workloads in terms of execution time, and significant reductions in network traffic, over a traditional physical mapping. Moreover, when compared to a first-touch mapping policy, our proposal improves average execution time by 5% for parallel applications and 6% for multi-programmed workloads, slightly increasing on-chip network traffic. textcopyright2009 IEEE.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Future CMP designs that will integrate tens of processor cores on-chip will be constrained by area and power. Area constraints make impractical the use of a bus or a crossbar as the on-chip interconnection network, and tiled CMPs organized around a direct interconnection network will probably be the architecture of choice. Power constraints make impractical to rely on broadcasts (as Token-CMP does) or any other brute-force method for keeping cache coherence, and directory-based cache coherence protocols are currently being employed. Unfortunately, directory protocols introduce indirection to access directory information, which negatively impacts performance. In this work, we present DiCo-CMP, a novel cache coherence protocol especially suited to future tiled CMP architectures. In DiCo-CMP the role of storing up-to-date sharing information and ensuring totally ordered accesses for every memory block is assigned to the cache that must provide the block on a miss. Therefore, DiCo-CMP reduces the miss latency compared to a directory protocol by sending coherence messages directly from the requesting caches to those that must observe them (as it would be done in brute-force protocols), and reduces the network traffic compared to Token-CMP (and consequently, power consumption in the interconnection network) by sending just one request message for each miss. Using an extended version of GEMS simulator we show that DiCo-CMP achieves improvements in execution time of up to 8% on average over a directory protocol, and reductions in terms of network traffic of up to 42% on average compared to Token-CMP. textcopyright2008 IEEE.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Although directory-based cache coherence protocols are the best choice when designing chip multiprocessor architectures (CMPs) with tens of processor cores on chip, the memory overhead introduced by the directory structure may not scale gracefully with the number of cores. In this work, we show that a directory organization based on duplicating tags, which are distributed among the tiles of a tiled CMP with a fine-grained interleaving, is scalable. That is to say, the size of each directory bank is independent on the number of tiles of the system. Moreover, based on this directory organization we propose and evaluate the implicit replacements mechanism which leads to savings of up to 32% in terms of number of messages in the interconnection network.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Traditional directory-based cache coherence protocols suffer from long-latency cache misses as a consequence of the indirection introduced by the home node, which must be accessed on every cache miss before any coherence action can be performed. In this work we present a new protocol that moves the role of storing up-to-date coherence information (and thus ensuring totally ordered accesses) from the home node to one of the sharing caches. Our protocol allows most cache misses to be directly solved from the corresponding remote caches, without requiring the intervention of the home node. In this way, cache miss latencies are reduced. Detailed simulations show that this protocol leads to improvements in total execution time of 8% on average over a highly optimized MOESI directory-based protocol. textcopyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Multi-core processors are a shift of paradigm in computer architecture that promises a dramatic increase in performance. But multi-core processors also bring an unprecedented level of complexity in algorithmic design and software development. In this paper we describe the challenges and design choices involved in parallelizing a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on a state-of-the-art multi-core processor, the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell BE). Our experiments obtained on a pre-production Cell BE board running at 3.2 GHz show almost linear speedups when using multiple synergistic processing units, and an impressive level of performance when compared to other processors. The Cell BE is typically an order of magnitude faster than conventional processors, such as the AMD Opteron and the Intel Pentium 4 and Woodcrest, an order of magnitude faster than the MTA-2 multi-threaded processor, and two orders of magnitude faster than a BlueGene/L processor.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Traditionally, cache coherence in large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors has been ensured by means of a distributed directory structure stored in main memory. In this way, the access to main memory to recover the sharing status of the block is generally put in the critical path of every cache miss, increasing its latency. Considering the ever-increasing distance to memory, these cache coherence protocols are far from being optimal from the perspective of performance. On the other hand, shared-memory multiprocessors formed by connecting chips that integrate the processor, caches, coherence logic, switch and memory controller through a low-cost, low-latency point-to-point network (glueless shared-memory multiprocessors) are a reality. In this work, we propose a novel design for the L2 cache level, at which coherence has to be maintained, aimed at being used in glueless shared-memory multiprocessors. Our proposal splits the cache structure into two different parts: one for storing data and directory information for the blocks requested by the local processor, and another one for storing only directory information for blocks accessed by remote processors. Using this cache scheme we remove the directory from main memory. Besides saving memory space, our proposal brings very significant reductions in terms of latency of the cache misses (speed-ups of 3.0 on average), which translate into reductions in applications' execution time of 31% on average.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Recent technology improvements allow multiprocessor designers to put some key components inside the processor chip, such as the memory controller, the coherence hardware, and the network interface/router. In this paper, we exploit such integration scale, presenting a novel node architecture aimed at reducing the long L2 miss latencies and the memory overhead of using directories that characterize cc-NUMA machines and limit their scalability. Our proposal replaces the traditional directory with a novel three-level directory architecture, as well as it adds a small shared data cache to each of the nodes of a multiprocessor system. Due to their small size, the first-level directory and the shared data cache are integrated into the processor chip in every node, which enhances performance by saving accesses to the slower main memory. Scalability is guaranteed by having the second and third-level directories out of the processor chip and using compressed data structures. A taxonomy of the L2 misses, according to the actions performed by the directory to satisfy them, is also presented. Using execution-driven simulations, we show that significant latency reductions can be obtained by using the proposed node architecture, which translates into reductions of more than 30 percent in several cases in the application execution time. textcopyright 2004 IEEE.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This paper focuses on reducing the execution time of the video compression algorithms based on the 3D wavelet transform. We present several optimizations that could not be applied by the compiler due to the characteristics of the algorithm. First, we use the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) for some of the dimensions of the sequence (y and time), in order to reduce the number of floating point instructions, exploiting data level parallelism. Then, we apply loop unrolling and data prefetching to critical parts of the code, and finally the algorithm is vectorized by columns, allowing the use of SIMD instructions for the y dimension. Results show improvements of up to 1.54 over a version compiled with the maximum optimizations of the Intel CIC++ compiler Our experiments also show that, allowing the compiler to perform some of these optimizations (i.e. automatic code vectorization) causes performance slowdown which demonstrates the effectiveness of our optimizations.</td>

<p style="font-size: 14px;">Manuel E. Acacio is a Professor of computer architecture and technology at the University of Murcia, Spain. He  joined the Computer Engineering Department (DiTEC) in 1998, after I received the MS degree in computer science. He started as a Teaching Assistant. At the same time, he began his work on his PhD thesis. In the summer of 2002, he worked as a summer intern at IBM TJ Watson Research Center (Yorktown Heights, NY), as part of the Blue Light Systems Development Department. In March 2003,  after four years of hard work, he was awarded his PhD. After that, he became an Assistant Professor in 2004, and subsequently, an Associate Professor in 2008. In June 2018 he was promoted to Full Professor.</p>
